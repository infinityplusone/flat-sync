## Sync your score, Yoni-style

### Caveats & Warnings
* Make sure there are **no repeats** in your score. It cannot handle them. Just copy and past those sections instead if you want to use it.
* I was lazy when I wrote this and it fails with some time signatures. If that happens, let me know, so I can address it.

### How to Use
1. Add the <a href="https://github.com/infinityplusone/flat-sync/blob/master/sync-bookmarklet.js" target="_blank">Sync Bookmarklet</a> to your browser.<br> <div style="overflow:hidden;height:350px;margin-top:5px;"><img src="Add%20the%20Bookmarklet.gif" alt="Add the Bookmarklet" /></div>
2. Open <a href="https://flat.io" target="_blank">your score</a> in a browser tab.
3. If you haven't already, post your score to either <a href="https://soundcloud.com" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, or <a href="https://vimeo.com" target="_blank">Vimeo</a>. _Your score must be published on one of these services **first** for this to work._
4.  Open the <a href="https://flat.io/developers/docs/api/console.html" target="_blank">Flat API Console</a> in a browser tab.

## Sync your score, Yoni-style

### Warnings

1. Your score doesn't have any repeats. It cannot handle them. Just copy and past those sections instead if you want to use it.
2. I was lazy when I wrote this and it fails with some time signatures. I need to address that, but I haven't yet. 

### How to Use

1. Add the Sync bookmarklet to your browser.

2. Watch this video: <video controls="controls" width="800" height="600" name="Flat Sync Score" src="Flat%20-%20Sync%20Score.mov"></video>
